We have uploaded and made public the four datasets used in this study, which can be downloaded from https://zenodo.org/records/12792163.
Additionally, you can find these datasets on the following websitesï¼š
-  DLPFC dataset consists of 12 sections of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) sampled from three individuals. The number of spots for each section ranges from 3498 to 4789. The original authors have manually annotated the areas of the DLPFC layers and white matter. The datasets are available in the spatialLIBD package from http://spatial.libd.org/spatialLIBD.
-  MouseBrain dataset includes a coronal brain section sample from an adult mouse, with 2903 sampled spots. The datasets are available in https://cf.10xgenomics.com/samples/spatial-exp/1.1.0/V1_Adult_Mouse_Brain/V1_Adult_Mouse_Brain_web_summary.html.
-  Human Breast Cancer1 (BC1) dataset includes a fresh frozen invasive ductal carcinoma breast tissue section sample, with 3813 sampled spots. The datasets are available in https://www.10xgenomics.com/datasets/human-breast-cancer-block-a-section-1-1-standard-1-0-0.
-  Human Breast Cancer2 (BC2) dataset includes a formalin-fixed invasive breast carcinoma tissue section sample, with 2518 sampled spots. The datasets are available in https://www.10xgenomics.com/datasets/human-breast-cancer-ductal-carcinoma-in-situ-invasive-carcinoma-ffpe-1-standard-1-3-0
